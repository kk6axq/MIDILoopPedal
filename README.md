# MIDI Loop Pedal
MIDILoopPedal is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) based loop pedal for use with an electric piano. It enables the user to record, dub, and playback multiple tracks in realtime.

This project is being conducted as an Honors Enrichment Contract for EGR201, Use-Inspired Design Project I, at Arizona State University on the Polytechnic Campus through Barrett, the Honors College, at Arizona State University, and under the guidance of Dr. Adam Carberry.

## Project Status
This project is organized into four main phases and two stretch phases. Minimum success will be demonstrated by completion of phase IV.<br>
**Phase I: Complete**
* ~~Create block diagram of major components~~
* ~~Select electrical components and build schematic~~
* ~~Build CAD model concept~~

**Phase II: Complete**
* ~~Build breadboard layout of electrical system~~
* ~~Test functionality of electrical system to receive and send key events~~
* ~~Build Solidworks Assembly of body~~

**Phase III: Complete**
* ~~Build proto-board or PCB layout for electrical system~~
* ~~Assemble electrical and mechanical system~~

**Phase IV: In Progress**
* Develop software to record and play back key events
* Test complete system

**Stretch Goal I:**
* Add USB MIDI interface mode

**Stretch Goal II:**
* Add multi-track recording or playback

## Project Structure
This repository will contain all files from the project as it progresses. The current structure is:
* **hardware**: Hardware design files for the CAD and EDA parts of the project. CAD parts are designed in Solidworks, and the electrical schematics are designed in KiCAD.
* **deliverables**: Deliverables for the different phases of the project. These are copies of the different files at the time of phase completion, but they serve as a moment-in-time survey of the project and help illustrate the design evolution over time.
