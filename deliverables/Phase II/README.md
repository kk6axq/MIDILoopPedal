# Phase II
Phase II deliverables centered around the testing of the electrical system and initial enclosure.

## Breadboard layout
The breadboard layout helped validate the schematic and component selection. The power LED was removed as the WS2812B indicator was found to be sufficient. The breadboard also allowed testing the initial software and ensuring communication between the microcontroller and the piano worked.
